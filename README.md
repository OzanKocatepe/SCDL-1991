# SCDL-1991

This repo stores the code to run the Crazyflies. Written by Ozan Kocatepe, using Vejaykarthy Srithar's code as a resource.

All of the code was written between the dates of 28-Feb-2025 and 23-May-2025.

**NOTE**: The log files which appear in 350mAh_logs which also appear in old_logs were performed under the belief that they had
0.75 horizontalSeparation. Instead, they turned out to have 1.0 horizontalSeparation due to a logic error. The headers have been
changed to reflect this.
