# SCDL-1991

This repo stores the code to run the Crazyflies.

Vejay Notes:
- check radio soldering
- makes ure you use n radios for n drones
- update uri
- don't use swarm?
- radio://radionumber

- don't start them close together (> 0.5)
- pause after taking off
- take off drones one after the other.
- same with landing.

- start larger distance
- keep track of where you need drone to take off and land. Don't let it go to (0, 0, 0).

- make sure lighthouse decks detectors are working.
